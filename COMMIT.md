### So you'd like to contribute?
Great! We'd love your help, whether your just passing by or want to become a regular member of our team. However we are currently still a school project, so we can't accept help in all areas.
### Translating
As you might have noticed MonkeyCrypt is all in German â€¦ :beers: We would like to make MonkeyCrypt available in many other languages though. And this is where you come in.
In the folder:
*src/text/*
you can find the folder
*en*
which has a lot of German texts in it. The aim is to fill this folder with English texts.
So:
+ fork the repository
+ open a txt file
+ replace the German text with an English translation
+ submit a pull request
If you'd like to translate MonkeyCrypt into another language, you can copy the whole folder *en*, rename it, and start the same procedure.

### Submitting Ideas or issues
We know that our program is still full of issues and problems. So if you found one just by playing around with the program, feel free to open an issue for us! We'll try to fix it.
MonkeyCrypt is a work in progress, and we have a lot of ideas for the future. Maybe you have an idea for us too! Feel free to add it to our list in IDEAS.md
