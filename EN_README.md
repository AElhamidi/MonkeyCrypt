# MonkeyCrypt
This modest Java Application aims to teach children the basics of (classical) cryptography, try out different encryption types and practice their skills. It was started by a Project-Seminar group of five German students, and is still a work in progress.
## How can I download MonkeyCrypt?
You can either clone and then compile this repository yourself and be completely up-to-date with the newest version of MonkeyCrypt. A .jar version will soon be available on our website, which is currently still under creation.
## Can I contribute to MonkeyCrypt?
We would love to have you on our team! The tasks range from checking typos and reporting bugs to programming new encryption methods or experimenting with GUI. We are also very keen on finding translators, so if you speak another language, feel free to contact us!
