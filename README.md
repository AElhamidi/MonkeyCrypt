# MonkeyCrypt
This modest Java Application aims to teach children the basics of (classical) cryptography, try out different encryption types and practice their skills. It was started by a Project-Seminar group of five German students, and is still a work in progress.
### How can I download MonkeyCrypt?
You can either clone and then compile this repository yourself and be completely up-to-date with the newest version of MonkeyCrypt. A .jar version will soon be available on our website, which is currently still under creation.
### This is so cool! Can I contribute to MonkeyCrypt?
Not yet! Since MonkeyCrypt is still a school project we aren't allowed to get any external help. However we will release it into the open-source world in time for Hacktoberfest 2017 (yay!). Until then we'd be glad to recieve any kind of feedback or advice.
