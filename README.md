# MonkeyCrypt
This modest Java Application aims to teach children the basics of (classical) cryptography, try out different encryption types and practice their skills. It was started by a Project-Seminar group of five German students, and is still a work in progress.
### How can I download MonkeyCrypt?
You can either clone and then compile this repository yourself and be completely up-to-date with the newest version of MonkeyCrypt. A .jar version will soon be available on our website, which is currently still under creation.
### This is so cool! Can I contribute to MonkeyCrypt?
Since MonkeyCrypt is still a school project and we aren't allowed to have external help, we can only accept commits in some sections. In celebration of the Hacktoberfest, we have an open issue good for beginners or translators. Happy Hacking! Read our COMMIT.md for more!
