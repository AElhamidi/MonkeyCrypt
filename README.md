# MonkeyCrypt
This modest Java Application aims to teach children the basics of (classical) cryptography, try out different encryption types and practice their skills. It was started by a Project-Seminar group of five German students, and is still a work in progress.
### How can I download MonkeyCrypt?
You can either clone and then compile this repository yourself and be completely up-to-date with the newest version of MonkeyCrypt. A .jar version is available under *releases* (See that tab on the top). This Beta - release still has a lot of open issues! However it has been created so beginner - contributors can more easily run our program and submit suggestions.

We still have the issue that texts aren't read into the jar version of the program. To make it possible, copy the jar into the repository next to the src folder, and it should work.

### This is so cool! Can I contribute to MonkeyCrypt?
Since MonkeyCrypt is still a school project and we aren't allowed to have external help, we can only accept commits in some sections. In celebration of the Hacktoberfest, we have an open issue good for beginners or translators. Happy Hacking! Read our COMMIT.md for more!
